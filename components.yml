# Each component, under files/utilities/graphics:
#     MUST have a "bay12" key set to the forum thread number
#     SHOULD have "host" set to one of "dffd", "github-asset", "github-source",
#       "bitbucket", or "manual".  If unset, defaults to "dffd" if "host" is an int,
#       "github-source" if under graphics, or "github-asset" otherwise.
#     MUST have "ident" set if host is not "manual"
#     MUST otherwise set "dl_link", "updated", and "version"
#     MUST set "extract_to" for files (see extract.py for details)
#     SHOULD add missing keys to "manifest"[.json] for graphics or utilities
#     MAY set "needs_dfhack" to True to avoid useless install
#     MUST set "install-after" if install order matters (eg DF>DFHack>TwbT)
#     MAY set "requires_bits" to "32" or "64" to avoid useless install if arch-dependent
